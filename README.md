Configure the external jars for the project: right click project -> properties -> java build path -> remove all associated external jars outside of JRE system library and JUnit 4 -> add external jars -> navigate to the Jars folder -> add all jars in the folder

Start MAMP on your computer. If your MAMP port is not 8889 (the default port), change it to this value: preferences -> ports -> set ports to default. We also assume that your default password/username = root. If not, you can edit these values in DJDatabaseTest (line 34) and NewsStoriesDatabaseTest (line 33).

You can now run the Test folder as a JUnit test.
